Steps of traffic state data extraction:

1. Run the simulation including 100% probe vehicles and get a Sqlite database.
2. Save "vehicle_info" table in the Sqlite database as a CSV file.
3. Open python script "1_Create_Database". 
4. At the end of the python script, modify the directory of the dataset, run this script
5. Close python script "1_Create_Database".
6. Open python script "2_generate_traffic_state".
7. In line 17, set "start_time".
   In line 19, set "end_time".
   In line 21, set "time_step".
   In line 23, set "link_length".
   In line 37, set "link_lane_number".
   In line 27, set the directory of the input CSV file.
   In line 43, set the directory of the output database file, which is the dataset created in step 4.
8. Run python script "2_generate_traffic_state".
9. After several hours, the extracted data is store in the created SQLite database.
